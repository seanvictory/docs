## Introduction

Today, nearly every software product has to integrate with dozens of third-party applications. Customers increasingly expect to buy software that integrates seamlessly with their existing cloud stack, but achieving this typically requires tremendous engineering effort to manually write and maintain code for every integration.

Paragon is a low-code platform that enables teams to easily integrate their product with third-party apps and APIs. Our platform provides ready-made integrations with popular apps like Salesforce, Slack, and Google that can be easily connected to your application using our visual workflow editor. A developer can usually integrate Paragon with their application in a few hours, after which new integrations can be easily added on Paragon by non-technical users such as product, growth, or client services teams.

### Integrating with your customers' apps

Compared to other integration platforms, Paragon is unique in that it enables you to deliver user-facing product integrations (e.g. connecting to your users' Salesforce, Slack, or Google accounts). We provide managed OAuth 2.0 authentication to allow your users to securely connect their apps to your product in a way that appears native to your app - your users don't see or interact with Paragon directly.

For example, you might want to display your customers' Salesforce records within your app, or send Slack notifications to your customers' Slack workspaces based on events from your app. With Paragon, integrations like these can be easily developed in a few hours without more than a few lines of code.

### Example use case

* Sync your customers' Salesforce records to display in your app

* Update your customers' Salesforce records with data from your app

* Send notifications to your customers' Slack workspaces

* Sync your customers' Google Calendar events to display in your app

* Create events in your customers' Google Calendar from events in your app


## How Paragon works


Integrations on Paragon are defined with **workflows**. Workflows consist of **steps**, which are actions like sending a Slack message, making an API request, or querying a database. Using Paragon's visual workflow editor, you can drag and drop these steps to connect third party apps to your product and define your integration logic.

There are typically 4 main parts to building an integration with Paragon:

1.  **Connect Paragon to your app** either by database or API

2.  **Connect Paragon to an integration** like Slack, Salesforce, or Google

3.  **Authenticate users** by providing a Paragon sign-in URL in your app

4.  **Define integration logic** with Paragon's drag-and-drop visual workflow editor


In addition to enabling teams to easily develop integrations, Paragon makes it easy to run and manage them in production with one-click deploys and autoscaling. You can visualize the flow of data throughout each workflow execution in [Task History](/automate/building-workflows/viewing-task-history), making it easy to visually monitor and debug activity.

Throughout this documentation, we'll provide detailed instructions on how to build, manage, and deliver integrations with Paragon. If you have any questions that aren't answered by our documentation, you can always reach us at [team@useparagon.com](mailto:team@useparagon.com)!
