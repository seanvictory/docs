# Setup Guide

You can find your Gong app credentials in your [Gong Developer Account.](https://api.gong.io)

You'll need the following information to set up your Gong App with Paragon Connect:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Scopes Requested

<Info>
This is an **API-only** integration - workflow actions for this integration are still in development. You can still connect user accounts, build workflows, and access the API for this integration.
</Info>

## Add your Gong app to Paragon

Under **Integrations &gt; Connected Integrations &gt;** _**{YOUR\_APP}**_ **&gt;** **Settings**, fill out your credentials from your developer app in their respective sections:

* **Client ID:** Found under ____ on your Gong App page.
* **Client Secret:** Found under ____ on your Gong App page.
* **Permissions:** Select the scopes you've requested for your application.

<Info>
Leaving the Client ID and Client Secret blank will use Paragon development keys.

# Connecting to Gong

Once your users have connected their Gong account, you can use the Paragon SDK to access the Gong API on behalf of connected users.

See the Gong [REST API documentation](https://api.gong.io) for their full API reference.

Any Gong API endpoints can be accessed with the Paragon SDK as shown in this example.

```javascript
// You can find your project ID in the Overview tab of any Integration

// Authenticate the user
paragon.authenticate(<ProjectId>, <UserToken>);
            
// Get all Calls after a specified date
paragon.request("gong", "/v2/calls?fromDateTime=2018-02-18T02:30:00-07:00", {
  method: "GET"
});
// Create a new Call
paragon.request("gong", "/v2/calls", {

});
  
```

# Building Gong workflows

Once your Gong account is connected, you use the Gong Request step to access any of Gong's API endpoints without the authentication piece.

When creating or updating records in Gong, you can reference data from previous steps by typing `{{` to invoke the variable menu.
