```
2. Log into your [Gong Developer Portal](https://developer.gong.com/).

3. Select your app from the list of apps.

4. Under **Redirect URL**, paste-in the redirect URL from Paragon. The redirect URL can be found in Step 1.

5. Press the `Save` button to confirm your changes.

## Add your Gong app to Paragon

Under **Integrations > Connected Integrations >** ***\{YOUR\_APP}*** **>** **Settings**, fill out your credentials from your developer app in their respective sections:

* **Client ID:** Found under Client ID on your Gong App page.

## Connecting to Gong

Once your users have connected their Gong account, you can use the Paragon SDK to access the Gong API on behalf of connected users.

See the Gong [REST API documentation](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview) for their full API reference.

Any Gong API endpoints can be accessed with the Paragon SDK as shown in this example.

```javascript
// You can find your project ID in the Overview tab of any Integration

// Authenticate the user
paragon.authenticate(<ProjectId>, <UserToken>);
            
// Get all Calls after a specified date
paragon.request("gong", "/v2/calls?fromDateTime=2018-02-18T02:30:00-07:00", {
  method: "GET"
});

// Create a new Call
paragon.request("gong", "/v2/calls", {
  method: "POST",
  body: {
    "actualStart": "2018-02-17T02:30:00-08:00",

// Get Log Data after a specified date
paragon.request("gong", " /v2/logs?fromDateTime=2018-02-18T02:30:00-07:00", {
  method: "GET"
});
```

## Building Gong workflows

Once your Gong account is connected, you can add steps to perform the following actions:

* Add a new Call
* Get Call by ID
* Search for Call

When creating or updating records in Gong, you can reference data from previous steps by typing `{{` to invoke the variable menu. You can also use the Gong Request step to access any of Gong's API endpoints without the authentication piece.
