# Setup Guide

### **Select an authentication strategy for your users**

Selecting an authentication strategy is the first step to building a NetSuite integration on Paragon. Paragon supports three methods for authenticating against your users' NetSuite systems, **Authorization Code, Client Credentials, and Client Credentials with User Certificates**. Your selection will affect the user experience of your connected users.

* **Authorization Code –** Paragon will use the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the NetSuite app you create to initiate OAuth 2.0 flow on behalf of your connecting users.&#x20;

* **Client Credentials –** your connecting users are required to create their own client apps within their NetSuite instances.

* **Client Credentials with User Certificates –** your connecting users are required to create their own client app and generate a certificate to authenticate requests.

We recommend developers use the **Authorization Code** method to optimize for a more seamless user experience for your connecting users.&#x20;

**How do I choose what authentication**

| Authentication Type                      | Connecting User Experience | **Authentication Lifetime**                | Developer Inputs Required                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| Authorization Code                       | Minimal setup              | Requires user to reconnect every 7-14 days | Provide App Credentials                                 |
| Client Credentials                       | Some user involvement      |                                            | User provides app credentials                           |
| Client Credentials with User Certificate | High user involvement      | Authenticated for 2 years                  | User provides app credentials and generates certificate |

### **Enabling the OAuth 2.0 feature in your NetSuite test instance**

Enabling the OAuth 2.0 and SuiteScript features in NetSuite are the first steps for configuring your NetSuite sandbox instance to Paragon Connect.

1. Navigate to **Setup > Company > Enable Features** then select the **SuiteCloud** tab.

2. Check the boxes for enabling **Client SuiteScript**, **Server SuiteScript**, and **OAuth 2.0**.

3. Click **Save.**&#x20;

### **Creating a NetSuite OAuth application**

Now you can create your NetSuite app credentials in your NetSuite instance's Integration Management Settings. This is found under **Setup > Integration > Manage Integrations > New**.

1. Add a **Name**, a **Description**, and click to change the **State** dropdown to ***Enabled***.

2. Enable the ***Token-Based Authentication*** checkbox, ***Authorization Code Grant**,* and ***Public Client*** options under **Authorization**.

3. Add the Paragon ***Redirect URL***

```
https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth
```

1. Select the three scopes: `RESTLETS`, `REST WEB SERVICES`, and `SUITEANALYTICS`.

You'll need the following information from the NetSuite application registration to set up your NetSuite App with Paragon Connect:

* Consumer Key

* Consumer Secret

* Scopes Requested

### Add your NetSuite app to Paragon

In the Paragon Dashboard under **Integrations > Connected Integrations >** **NetSuite** **>** **Settings**, fill out your credentials from your NetSuite app in their respective sections:

* **Client ID:** Found under Setup > Integration > Manage Integrations on your NetSuite App page.

* **Client Secret:** Found under Setup > Integration > Manage Integrations on your NetSuite App page.

* **Permissions:** Select the scopes you've requested for your application.
