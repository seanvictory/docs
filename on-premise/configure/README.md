# Configuring a Managed Instance

## Overview

[Paragon](https://www.useparagon.com/) allows customers the option of self-hosting Paragon on your own infrastructure. All the resources live in your AWS, Azure, or GCP, and data never leaves your cloud.

We additionally offer a Managed On-Premise solution that almost 100% of our on-prem customers use at no additional cost. In this model, our enterprise team will take care of deploying, configuring, and managing your installation to offload 100% of developer time while providing the security and transparency of owning the resources and confidence that other resources in your Azure account are inaccessible.
