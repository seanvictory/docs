# Hosting Paragon On-Premise

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Paragon On-Premise is only available on our [Enterprise plan](https://www.useparagon.com/pricing). If you're evaluating Paragon for a large production use case or have any questions about our Enterprise plan, please [book a call](https://useparagon.com/book-demo).
{% endhint %}

Paragon offers an on-premise solution that allows you to run Paragon on your own infrastructure. AWS, Azure, and GCP have first-class support, but you can run it anywhere that has internet access, Kubernetes support, Postgres database, and Redis cache.

Paragon On-Premise is often used by companies that need to:

* Store or work with personally identifiable information (PII)
* Remain compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)
* Have stricter policies, procedures, or contracts with enterprise customers

Paragon is SOC2 Type 2 certified, and both our cloud and managed on-premise solutions adhere to the policies and procedures required in the certification. Read more [here](https://www.useparagon.com/blog/soc-2-type-1).

We offer several solutions including:

* Cloud
* Single Tenant
* Managed On-Premise
* Unmanaged On-Premise
