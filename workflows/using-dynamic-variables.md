# Using Dynamic Variables

## Overview

The Dynamic Variable Menu allows you to select data from previous steps, the Connect Portal, and the [Paragon User Token](../getting-started/installing-the-connect-sdk.md#2.-generate-a-paragon-user-token). For example, you might want to dynamically reference data from your application's actions when creating new messages in Slack.

## Accessing Dynamic Variables

To access the Dynamic Variable Menu:

1. Click into any text input box.
2. Type two left curly braces `{{` .
3. Select the step you want to pull data from.
4. Select the specific reference you want to use.
