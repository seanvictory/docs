You can filter the list of versions by:

* All Versions
* Named versions
* Saved versions
* Deployed versions

## Saving a new version of your workflow

Versions will be made whenever you perform one of the following actions:

* Deploy the workflow
* Press ⌘⇧S on macOS or  `CTRL` + `Shift` + `S` on Windows
* Restore to a previous version
* Every 10th update or edit to your workflow

## Viewing or reverting to earlier versions of workflows

1. In [Paragon](https://app.useparagon.com/), open your workflow.
2. Click the **Horizontal three dots > Manage Versions**
3. Click a timestamp to see a previous version of the workflow. Below the timestamp, you'll see the name of the person who saved or deployed the workflow.
4. (Optional) To revert to this version, click **Restore this version.**
