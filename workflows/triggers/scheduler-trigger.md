# Scheduler Trigger

The Scheduler trigger is used for workflows that should run automatically at a **scheduled time or interval**.&#x20;

The Scheduler trigger provides the following scheduling options:â€Œ

* **Seconds** (e.g. every 5 seconds)
* **Minutes** (e.g. every 30 minutes)
* **Hourly** (e.g. every hour at 15 minutes past the hour)
* **Daily** (e.g. every 2 days at 9:00 am)
* **Weekly** (e.g. every Monday at 12:00 pm)

Once deployed, the workflow will run automatically at the designated time for all users who have activated the workflow in their Connect Portal.

### Configuring Variable Time Zones

You can configure the Scheduler such that workflows run at a specific time in the user's time zone by using [User Metadata](../../api/users.md).

Paragon uses IANA-formatted time zones. For example, you would use `America/Los_Angeles` for users in the Pacific Time Zone. You can view a full list of time zone identifiers [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_database\_time\_zones).
