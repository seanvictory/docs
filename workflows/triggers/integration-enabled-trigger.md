# Integration Enabled Trigger

Integration Enabled triggers can be used to run workflows when a user initially activates your integration. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow that syncs all leads from your customer's CRM to your application once they've enabled the integration.

The Integration Enabled trigger will fire when your user connects their integration to an account AND they have completed any required [User Settings](../../connect-portal/workflow-user-settings.md) in the Connect Portal.
