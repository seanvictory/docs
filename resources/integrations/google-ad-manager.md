# Google Ad Manager

## Setup Guide

You can find your Google app credentials by visiting your [Google Cloud Console dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?supportedpurview=project).&#x20;

You'll need the following information to set up your Google App with Paragon Connect:

* Client ID
* Client Secret
* Scopes Requested

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You'll need to create a new project in Google Cloud Console if you don't already have one.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an **API-only** integration - workflow actions for this integration are still in development. You can still connect user accounts, build workflows, and access the API for this integration.
{% endhint %}

### Add the Redirect URL to your Google app

Paragon provides a redirect URL to send information to your Google app. To add the redirect URL to your Google app:

1\. Copy the link under "**Redirect URL"** in your integration settings in Paragon. The Redirect URL is:

```
https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth
```

2\. In your [Google Cloud Console dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?supportedpurview=project), navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials** in the sidebar.

3\. Press "**+ Create Credentials**", then select **OAuth client ID.**

4\. Select "**Web application**" from the Application type drop-down menu.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** You'll need to configure Google's [consent screen](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) for access to **Client ID** and **Client Secret** if you haven't already.
{% endhint %}

5\. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, press the "**+ Add URI**" button.

6\. Paste-in the redirect URL from Paragon.

7\. Press the blue "**Create**" button.

Google provides you with the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** needed for the next steps after adding the redirect URL to your project.

### Add your Google app to Paragon

1\. Select **Google Ad Manager** from the **Integrations Catalog**.

2\. Under **Integrations > Connected Integrations > **_**{YOUR\_APP}**_** >** **Settings**, fill out your credentials from the end of [Step 1](google-ad-manager.md#add-the-redirect-url-to-your-google-app) in their respective sections:

* **Client ID:** Found at the end of Step 1.
* **Client Secret:** Found at the end of Step 1.
* **Permissions:** Select the scopes you've requested for your application.

Press the blue "**Connect**" button to save your credentials.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Leaving the Client ID and Client Secret blank will use Paragon development keys.
{% endhint %}

## Connecting to Google Ad Manager

Once your users have connected their Google Ad Manager account, you can use the Paragon SDK to access the Google Ad Manager API on behalf of connected users.

See the Google Ad Manager [REST API documentation](https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/api/rel\_notes) for their full API reference.

Any Google Ad Manager API endpoints can be accessed with the Paragon SDK as shown in this example.

```javascript
// You can find your project ID in the Overview tab of any Integration

// Authenticate the user
paragon.authenticate(<ProjectId>, <UserToken>);
            
// Create an Order
paragon.request("googleadmanager", "/createOrder ", {
  method: "POST",
  body: {
    name: "My Order",
    advertiserId: <ADVERTISER_ID>,
    traffickerId: <TRAFFICKER_ID>,
  }
});

// Query Line Items
paragon.request("googleadmanager", "/getLineItemsByStatement", {
  method: "GET"
});
  
```

## Building Google Ad Manager workflows

Once your Google Ad Manager account is connected, you use the Google Ad Manager Request step to access any of Google Ad Manager's API endpoints without the authentication piece.

When creating or updating records in Google Ad Manager, you can reference data from previous steps by typing `{{` to invoke the variable menu.

## Publishing your Google Ad Manager application

### Setting up a Redirect Page in your app <a href="#setting-up-a-redirect-page-in-your-app" id="setting-up-a-redirect-page-in-your-app"></a>

Your Google Ad Manager integration requires a Redirect Page hosted in your application to support verification of your application by Google.

The Redirect Page should be implemented as follows:

* Receives a `GET` request with a number of query parameters.
* Redirect to `https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth` with the same query parameters.

```javascript
paragon.connect("googleadmanager", {
  overrideRedirectUrl: "https://your-app.url/google-ad-manager-redirect"
});
```

### Updating the allowed Redirect URL <a href="#updating-the-allowed-redirect-url" id="updating-the-allowed-redirect-url"></a>

If you were previously testing with `https://passport.useparagon.com/oauth` as your Google Ad Manager Redirect URL, you will need to update this value after implementing a Redirect Page:

1. Log into your [Google Cloud Console dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?supportedpurview=project) and select your application.
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials** and select the credentials you use with Paragon.
3. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, provide the URL of your Redirect Page.
