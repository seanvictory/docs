## Connecting to ClickUp

Once your users have connected their ClickUp account, you can use the Paragon SDK to access the ClickUp API on behalf of connected users.

See the ClickUp [REST API documentation](https://clickup.com/api) for their full API reference.

Any ClickUp API endpoints can be accessed with the Paragon SDK as shown in this example.

```javascript
// You can find your project ID in the Overview tab of any Integration

// Authenticate the user
paragon.authenticate(<ProjectId>, <UserToken>);
            
// Get current team information
await paragon.request("clickup", "/team", {
  method: "GET"
});

// Get lists outside of folders
await paragon.request("clickup", "/space/<Space ID>/list?archived=false", {
  method: "GET"
});

// Create task in list
await paragon.request("clickup", "/list/<List ID>/task", {
  method: "POST",
  body: {
    name: "New Task Name",
    description: "New Task Description",
    status: "Open"
  }
});
  
```

## Building ClickUp workflows

Once your ClickUp account is connected, you can add steps to perform the following actions:

* Create Task
* Update Task
* Get Task by ID
* Search Tasks
* Delete Task

When creating or updating Tasks in ClickUp, you can reference data from previous steps by typing `{{` to invoke the variable menu.

## Using Webhook Triggers

Webhook triggers can be used to run workflows based on events in your users' ClickUp account. For example, you might want to trigger a workflow whenever new tasks are created in ClickUp to sync your users' ClickUp tasks to your application in real-time.

You can find the full list of Webhook Triggers for ClickUp below:

* **New Folder Created**
* **Folder Updated**
* **New List Created**
* **List Updated**
* **New Space Created**
* **Space Updated**
* **New Task Created**
* **Task Updated**
