Custom Integrations allow you to build your own custom integration with any app provider on Paragon, even if it's not natively supported by our integration catalog.

Similar to natively supported integrations on Paragon, Custom Integrations provide the following features:

1. **Embedded Connect Portal** for your customers to activate and configure the integration in your app.

2. **Fully managed authentication** with OAuth 2.0 or API Keys.

3. **Visual workflow editor** for creating custom integration logic.

4. **Access to any API methods** provided by the application's API.

## Building a Custom Integration

### Prerequisites

Before building a Custom Integration, ensure the following:

* The app provider must have a public API.

* You have access to the app provider's API documentation.

* If the app provider uses OAuth authentication, create a developer account and application.

* You have a Paragon account with a **paid plan**.

To begin, click the **build your own custom integration** button in the integration catalog. Complete the following steps:

### Step 1: Basic Info

Provide basic information about the app provider for display in the Connect Portal:

* **Name**: A short name for the app provider.

* **Description**: A brief description of the app provider.

* **App Icon**: Only SVG formats are accepted.

* **Accent Color**: Brand color used for portal accents.

### Step 2: Authentication Method

Choose an authentication method based on the app provider's API documentation:

* **OAuth 2.0**: For user-based account authentication (e.g., Salesforce).

* **API Keys**: For token-based authorization from the app provider.

### Step 3: Authentication Setup

#### OAuth 2.0

Configure OAuth settings by providing:

* Authorization URL

* Access Token URL

* Client ID

* Client Secret

* Scopes Requested

#### API Keys

Add input fields for API keys or user details as required by the app provider.

#### OAuth Client Credentials

Define the Access Token URL for exchanging authorization codes for access tokens.

Press `Enable` in the Connect Portal preview to validate the connection.

### Step 4: API Setup

Configure API settings:

* **API Base URL**: Base URL for API requests.

* **API Authorization**: Authentication details for API requests.

* **Test Endpoint URL**: Endpoint to validate user credentials via a `GET` request.

Test the setup and press `Finish` to save the configuration.

## Using Custom Integrations

### Workflow Builder

Make API requests to your app provider directly from the Workflow Builder. Paragon automatically includes `Authorization` details.

<Callout type="info" title="Info">
  Paragon includes the `Authorization` details configured in Step 3 in every request.
</Callout>

Learn more in the [Building Workflows](../workflows/building-workflows.md) and [Requests](../workflows/requests/) guides.

### Paragon SDK

Access the app provider's endpoints using the SDK. Prefix the app provider name with `custom.` (e.g., `custom.github`).

```javascript
// Example: JavaScript SDK
paragon.authenticate(<ProjectId>, <UserToken>);

await paragon.request("custom.<app_provider_name>", "<api_endpoint>", {
  method: "GET",
});
```

### Connect API

To issue requests from your server:

```http
POST https://proxy.useparagon.com/projects/<Paragon Project ID>/sdk/proxy
  /custom/<Integration ID>/<API path>

Authorization: Bearer <Paragon User Token>
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Example:**

```http
POST https://proxy.useparagon.com/projects/19d...012/sdk/proxy
    /fb243b75-35e7-46b3-ba6c-967ccebeb449/notifications

Authorization: Bearer eyJ...
Content-Type: application/json
