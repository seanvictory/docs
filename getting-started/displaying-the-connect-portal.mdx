Once an integration has been added to the Paragon dashboard, you can now display the Connect Portal for that integration in your application. The **Connect Portal** is a component that your users interact with to connect their third-party app accounts to your application. The Connect Portal provides a **fully managed authentication** so you don't need to worry about managing, storing, or refreshing your customers' credentials.

## Activating the Integration


You'll need to mark your integration as `active` for it to display to your end users. To do this, just click the "Inactive" button in the top-right corner and press "Activate".

## Displaying the Connect Portal in your app


[`.authenticate`](/api/api-reference#authenticate-projectid-string-usertoken-string) should be called at the beginning of your application's lifecycle in all cases. This is to make sure that the `userToken` is always as fresh as possible, with respect to your user's existing session on your own site. You may reference [Installing the Connect SDK](/getting-started/installing-the-connect-sdk#setup) for a detailed explanation on how to use [`.authenticate`](/api/api-reference#authenticate-projectid-string-usertoken-string).

**Example:**

```js
await paragon.authenticate(
  // You can find your project ID in the Overview tab of any Integration
  "38b1f170-0c43-4eae-9a04-ab85325d99f7",

  // See Setup for how to encode your user token
  "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.ey..."
);
```

Once [`.authenticate`](/api/api-reference#authenticate-projectid-string-usertoken-string) has been called and the Promise it returns has resolved, you can call [`.connect`](/api/api-reference#connect-integrationtype-string) to launch your Connect Portal for a specific integration provider. You can find the `integrationType` identifier you need in the Overview page for the integration.

**Example:**

```js
paragon.connect("salesforce");
```
You _must_ have an integration configured of this `integrationType` for the Portal to appear. Otherwise, this function does nothing.

Once your user connects their third-party app account in the Connect Portal, you can access their app account by creating Workflows or via the [Paragon API](/api/making-api-requests). You can always call [`.getUser`](/api/api-reference#getuser-paragonuser) to retrieve the currently authenticated user and their connected integration state.
