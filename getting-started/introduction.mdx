### What you'll build

In this guide, we'll walk you through installing the Paragon SDK, setting up your first integration, and authenticating your first Connected User.

This guide will show you how to:

2. Create a new Integration

3. Authenticate a user's app account

4. Access the user's app account via the Paragon API

### Before getting started

To get the most out of this guide, you'll need:

* A [Paragon ](https://app.useparagon.com/signup)account.
