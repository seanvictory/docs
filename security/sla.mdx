# Service Level Agreement

## Overview

Paragon provides a 99.9% uptime commitment for customers on any paid plan.

## Downtime

**Downtime** is the total number of minutes Paragon is unavailable during a fiscal quarter. Downtime excludes:

- Slowness or performance issues with individual features.
- Issues related to external integrations or third parties.
- Features marked as pilot, alpha, or beta.
- External network or equipment issues outside our control.
- Scheduled maintenance.

## Uptime Commitment

**Uptime** is calculated as:

```
(total minutes in quarter - Downtime) / total minutes in quarter > 99.9%
```

### Scheduled Downtime

We provide at least 24 hours' notice for scheduled maintenance.

### Service Credits

If we fall short of our uptime commitment, customers may receive service credits equal to 2x the amount paid during the affected period, applicable to the next billing cycle.

Conditions for service credits:
- Credits are capped at 30 days of service.
- Requests must be made in writing within the same fiscal quarter as the downtime.

Service credits are not refundable and are the sole remedy for SLA breaches.
