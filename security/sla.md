# Service Level Agreement

## Overview

Paragon provides a 99.9% uptime commitment for customers on any paid plan.

## Downtime

**Downtime** is the overall number of minutes Paragon is unavailable during a fiscal quarter (three month periods). Paragon calculates unavailability using server monitoring software to measure the server side error rate, ping test results, web server tests.

Downtime excludes the following:

* Slowness or other performance issues with individual features (task history, replay, workflow editing).
* Issues that are related to external integrations or third parties.
* Any products or features identified as pilot, alpha, beta, or similar.
* External network or equipment problems outside of our reasonable control, such as DNS issues or cloud provider downtime.
* Scheduled downtime for maintenance.

## Uptime Commitment

**Uptime** is the percentage of total minutes Paragon was available during a fiscal quarter.

**(total minutes in quarter - Downtime) / total minutes in quarter > 99.9%**

#### Scheduled Downtime

Sometimes we need to perform maintenance to keep Paragon working smoothly. If scheduled downtime is necessary, we'll do our best to give you at least 24 hours advance notice.

#### Service Credits

If we fall short of our Uptime commitment, we'll apply a credit to each affected account equal to 2 times the amount that the organization paid during the period Paragon was down (**Service Credits**) for the next billing cycle.

Service Credits are not refunds, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, are capped at a maximum of 30 days of paid services, require you to have paid any outstanding invoices and expire upon termination of your contract or subscription. Service Credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Paragon to meet its obligations under this SLA. Service Credits must be requested in written format during the same fiscal quarter in which the downtime occurred to be applied.

Downtime doesn't affect everyone at the same time or in the same way due to the separation of services and data. Service Credits applied to one customer don't guarantee Service Credits will be applied to another.
