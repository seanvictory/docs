## Policy Compliance

### Data Protection Agreement

We have a Data Protection Agreement (DPA) that outlines our obligations and procedures. Customers can request it by emailing [privacy@useparagon.com](mailto:privacy@useparagon.com). Details are in our [GDPR documentation](gdpr.md).

### Policy Coverage

- Third-Party Connectivity
- Data Privacy
- Access Control
- Encryption Standards

## Security Practices

### Physical and Environmental Security

Our data is stored in AWS Cloud. Access logs are maintained in AWS CloudWatch. Incoming traffic is logged for security.

### Access to Data

We maintain separate AWS accounts for sandbox and live environments. Access to the live environment requires additional authentication, including a whitelisted IP.

### Data Storage & Encryption

Third-party credentials are stored in a distributed vault, with encryption keys stored separately. Sensitive information like emails and passwords are never logged.

### Security and Staff Training

New employees follow the principle of least privilege, and training includes tools, best practices, and incident response plans.

## Change Management

Changes are handled via a continuous delivery system with automated tests and manual reviews by the CTO. All changes are logged.

## Incident Management

### Incident Response

Incidents are prioritized as P0 and resolved promptly. Documentation includes post-mortem reports shared with affected users if necessary.

### Security Incidents

Security breaches are addressed immediately, and impacted users are informed within one business day.
