You can restrict the visibility of workflows to specific users or groups with Workflow Permissions.

Workflow Permissions can be defined for any workflow as a set of conditions that a user's [metadata](../api/users.md#associate-connected-user-with-metadata) must match in order for the workflow to appear in their Connect Portal.

For example, you can use Workflow Permissions to:

* Limit the availability of workflows to users on specific pricing plans
* Build a bespoke workflow for a specific user
* Roll out a new workflow to a group of users, under a feature flag


<Info>
  Workflow Permissions is available on our **Enterprise plan** and above. Please [**contact us**](mailto:sales@useparagon.com) to enable this option in your account.

## Using Workflow Permissions

Workflow Permissions are available in the options for any Workflow on the [**Customize Connect Portal**](connect-portal-customization.md) page. Navigate to **Configuration > Workflows**, and choose any workflow to set Workflow Permissions.

To set Workflow Permissions, click **Update** and create conditions for the user's metadata object.

</Frame>
The fields shown in the field selection menu are based on the [User Metadata](../api/users.md#associate-connected-user-with-metadata) for the Test User, which you can update by clicking "Set User Metadata" at the bottom of the menu.

Finally, click **Save** to update the permissions for this workflow.


<Info>
  **Note:** If the workflow has already been enabled for existing users prior to this change, it will automatically be disabled if their metadata does not match the saved permissions.

## How Workflow Permissions are applied

If a Connected User does not satisfy the Workflow Permissions with the [User Metadata](../api/users.md#associate-connected-user-with-metadata) associated with them, the workflow:

* Will not appear in the Connect Portal for this user
* Cannot be enabled for this user using the [Users API](../api/users.md), [Connected Users Dashboard](../monitoring/users.md), or [by default](displaying-workflows.md#default-to-enabled)
* Cannot be triggered or executed for this user

Workflow Permissions are re-evaluated whenever the conditions change for the workflow _or_ when the metadata for the user has changed.
