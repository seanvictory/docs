A **Field Mapping** is a type of User Setting that allows your users to define a mapping between an object in your application (an "Application Object") and an object in their connected integration account (an "Integration Object").

## Overview

For example: let's say your integration needs to sync your user's Task records from your application to their Tasks in a Salesforce account.

To do that, you'll need to build up a **Mapping** between fields in your application's Tasks and fields for a Task in a connected Salesforce account, as illustrated below:

## Creating a Field Mapping

To create a Field Mapping User Setting, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab of the Customize Connect Portal screen for your integration.
2. Click on **Add Setting** and select **Field Mapping**.
3. Configure the Field Mapping settings, including the Application Object and Integration Object.

<Info>
You can add multiple Field Mappings to a single integration if needed.

## Using Field Mappings in Workflows

Once you've created a Field Mapping, you can use the mapped fields in your workflows. The mapped fields will be available as variables in the Variable Menu when configuring workflow steps.

<Hint>
Make sure to test your Field Mappings thoroughly to ensure that data is being synced correctly between your application and the connected integration.
