### Overview

Custom Dropdowns allow you to include custom dropdown inputs in the Connect Portal as a part of the User Settings of your integration.

You can use Custom Dropdowns to allow your users to select:

* Data from your app, like a destination Project to sync Jira tickets into
* A type of User Setting that Paragon does not support natively, like a custom Salesforce enum.

### Usage

To get started with Custom Dropdowns, visit your User Settings and add a new type of **Custom Dropdown:**
<Frame>
	<img src="/.gitbook/assets/Customize Connect Portal - User config - Edit field.png"/>
</Frame>

Set a key name to refer to the dropdown when populating its available options.

After setting a key name, an example of the code you need to call from your application to populate the dropdown will appear in the dashboard:

```javascript
paragon.connect("jira", {
	dropdowns: {
		team: [{
			label: "Team 1",
			value: "team-1",
		}, {
			label: "Team 2", // tres -> Visible in dropdown
			value: "team-2", // 3 -> Returned in workflow editor
		}]
	}
});
```

Update your `paragon.connect` call to include the `dropdowns` parameter, which has the key names that you set above. This key can be set to an array of options with two keys:

* `label` — The displayed text shown to the user for the dropdown option.
* `value` — The value that will be saved (e.g. an option ID) when the user selects this dropdown option.
  * This value must be unique across all options in the array. If the value is found to be non-unique, the non-unique option will not be displayed in the list, and a console warning will appear.
  * If either `label` or `value` are missing, the option will not be displayed, and a console warning will appear.

When reading the selection for this User Setting from the SDK or the Workflow Editor, the value will be set to the `value` property of the chosen option (or undefined if unselected).
