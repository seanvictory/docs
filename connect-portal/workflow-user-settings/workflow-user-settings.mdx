**User Settings** provide options for your users to configure settings for their integration in the Connect Portal. This makes it easy for you to create integrations that work with custom objects or fields that may be specific to your users' third-party app accounts.

For example, common use cases include:

* **Slack** - choosing which channel that messages should be sent in
* **Salesforce** - choosing a custom opportunity stage that new opportunities created in
* **Hubspot** - choosing a custom lead status that new leads should be created with
* **Jira** - choosing which Jira user that new issues should be assigned to

User Settings can be defined globally at the integration level or locally at the workflow level.

* If they are included at the integration level, the User Settings can be referenced from any workflow for that integration.
* If they are included at the workflow level, the User Settings will appear when that workflow is enabled by your user and can only be referenced from the workflow it belongs to.

## Referencing User Settings in the Workflow Editor

Actions in Paragon will indicate when they accept User Settings as an input parameter. In these cases, you should first add the respective User Settings in the Connect Portal Editor, then use the **variable menu** to reference that User Setting in the Action sidebar.&#x20;


<Info>
  Enter two left curly braces `{{` to open the **dynamic** **variable menu.**

### Connecting a test account

By clicking **Connect** in the Connect Portal Preview, you can connect a test account for that integration and configure any of its Workflow User Settings for that test account.&#x20;

### **Testing workflows with user settings**

Once you've enabled an integration in the Connect Portal Preview, you can test its workflows using the **Test Workflow** or **Test Step** button in the Workflow Editor. This will test the workflow on the account that you connected in the Connect Portal Preview, and any User Settings you configured in the Connect Portal Preview will be used as test data.
