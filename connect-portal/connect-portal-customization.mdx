title: Customizing the Connect Portal
description: Control your end-user integration experience by customizing Connect Portal.
---

The **Connect Portal** is a component that your users interact with to connect their third-party app accounts to your application.

To edit the Connect Portal for an integration, click on **Customize Connect Portal** in the Integration Overview page to open the **Connect Portal Editor**.

In the Connect Portal Editor, you can customize different aspects of your Connect Portal:

* [**Overview**](connect-portal-customization.md#overview)**:** Edit the integration's description under the Connect Portal's Overview tab
* [**Configuration**](connect-portal-customization.md#configuration)**:** Edit the appearance of the integration's workflows and workflow settings under the Configuration tab
* [**Appearance**](connect-portal-customization.md#appearance)**:** Edit the visual appearance of the Connect Portal

## Overview

There are two options you can edit in the **Overview** tab:

* **Short description:** a one-line description of your integration that appears at the top of the Connect Portal.&#x20;
* **Overview**: a long-form description of your integration. This description is the first thing your users see when opening the Connect Portal, so this is the best place to describe and showcase your integration's benefits in detail to your users.


<Info>
  You can use [Markdown formatting](https://commonmark.org/help/) in the Overview section.

## Configuration

### Settings

* **Salesforce:** choosing a custom opportunity stage that new opportunities created in
* **Hubspot:** choosing a custom lead status that new leads should be created with
* **Jira:** choosing which Jira user that new issues should be assigned to

## Appearance
