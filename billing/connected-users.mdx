description: Learn how Connected Users are counted in Paragon.
---

Connected Users represent your customers that are connected to integrations in Paragon. A Connected User typically represents an organization, but can be implemented to represent any entity, such as an individual user.

Each Connected User is a **unique User ID connected to at least 1 integration.** A User ID is the subject (`sub`) field of the Paragon User Token used to [authenticate to the API or SDK](../getting-started/installing-the-connect-sdk.md#3.-call-paragon.authenticate).

You can view and manage your Connected Users in the Paragon dashboard. Learn more in [users.md](../monitoring/users.md "mention").

## Connected User limits and pricing

Your Paragon subscription includes a limit on Connected Users. You can view this limit and current usage in the header of the [Connected Users Dashboard](../monitoring/users.md).

</Frame>
All [Admin users](../managing-account/teams.md#managing-roles-and-permissions) in your organization will receive automated email notifications when your usage reaches 70%, 85%, and 100% of your Connected Users limit.

### What happens if I reach my Connected Users limit?

When you exceed this limit, new Connected Users will be unable to connect integrations. **Existing Connected Users will** _**not**_ ** be impacted**, and Workflows for existing Connected Users will continue to run.

You can reduce your usage of Connected Users by deleting inactive users from the [Connected Users Dashboard](../monitoring/users.md).
