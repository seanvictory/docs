## Priority Levels

Our support team will assign a priority to your ticket based on impact. Here are the standard definitions we use to classify your ticket:

* **Urgent:** Your production system is down. Widespread impact for multiple end-users and no workaround is possible. Could cause widespread impact if not resolved.
* **High:** Your production system is impaired or degraded in a significant way, for more than 1 end-user. Examples include significant performance delays. This is also the appropriate Priority for an Urgent issue once a workaround has been identified & provided.
* **Normal:** You have issues impacting a single end-user, but your overall production system is still performing. This would also include minor performance degradation that is noticeable but not high-impact. This is also the appropriate Priority for issues in staging or development environments.
* **Low:** An issue that is not impairing normal business operations, but warrants attention. Feature requests.
